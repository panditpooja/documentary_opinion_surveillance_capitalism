# My Opinion on *Surveillance Capitalism* Documentary

This repository contains my reflective opinion on the documentary *“Surveillance Capitalism”*, featuring Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff. The documentary delivers a profound critique of surveillance capitalism, revealing how personal data is covertly harvested and monetized by tech giants.  

As a master's student studying the socio-economic impacts of technology through INFO 536 (*Data Science, Public Interest*), I found the documentary especially impactful for understanding how Silicon Valley commodifies behavioral data—often without user knowledge or consent—and the implications for democracy, privacy, and human autonomy.

> *“The documentary argues that our digital behaviors have been ‘hijacked by Silicon Valley’ and commodified, often without our knowledge or consent. I found it particularly impactful in illustrating how tech giants exploit not just explicit data but also behavioral surplus—the unconscious digital traces that reveal far more than we knowingly share. Striking examples such as Pokémon Go’s influence on mobility, Google Nest’s hidden audio surveillance, and Facebook’s facial recognition practices show how predictive analytics and subliminal cues manipulate human behavior, reaching far beyond advertising.”*
